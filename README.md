# Data-Structure-And-Algorithm
This repository is complete based on my work on Data Structure and Algorithm
in the past few Months

Its a complete Coding Walkthrough in Data Structure and Algorithm along with 
working examples and Inteview Questions.

Terminologies-
-In every File the first complexity will be your Time Complexity and Second will be your space complexity
-Comments are given to ensure the understanding and purposes of the code

-Vision
-The direct solution to all your Data Structure and Algorithm related problems
-Use the code, debug it and understand the step by step thought process of solving those tedious data structures and algorihtms

P:s
-Few Examples contain many ways to solve a problems. Some Contains Instructor way and also my way of solving the problem and how to make your solution 
more optimum by using minimum time and space Complexity.

-Also this a dynamic repo things will be getting added to it time to time
-Leave your thoughts and problems and also suggestions to improve this repo at 
<amaan4743@gmail.com> always happy to hear you :-)
